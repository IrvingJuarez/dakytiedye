## Html tag convention (methodology)
- Every section in the <main/> tag will have the name of the page (home) followed by the name of the section itself (slider)
- As well the section will have the same class name but without the name of the page

Here a example
<code>
    <main>
        <section class="pageName-main_sectionName main_sectionName">

        </section>
    </main>
</code>
